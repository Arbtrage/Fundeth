# FundETH

### Objective:
The concept behind this project is to use cryptocurrency as a means of crowdfunding and investment for human initiatives. It aims to provide a decentralized and transparent way for individuals and organizations to fund and participate in certain projects.



### Transparency and Immunity:
- Verified identities are recorded as immutable and transparent entries on the blockchain.
- Publicly accessible and verifiable by anyone.

### Real-time Verification:
- Periodic identity checks to maintain the validity of registered organizations.
- Ensures that identities remain up-to-date on the blockchain.

### Conditional Access:
- Depending on verification status, organizations gain access to specific blockchain functionalities.
- Verified entities have extended privileges within the blockchain network.

### Investment Opportunities: 
- Users (investors) can browse through the listed projects and choose to invest in them. 
- They do so by purchasing project-specific tokens using our own cryptocurrency token build on Ethereum Blockchain .

### Decentralized Trust:
- Leverages decentralization, cryptographic security, and transparency to redefine trust in the blockchain space.

### Foundation of Confidence:
- Builds a trusted blockchain ecosystem where legitimacy is verified, and trust is paramount in every interaction.

"FundETH" aims to reshape the blockchain landscape by providing a secure, transparent, and verifiable platform for organizations to establish and maintain their legitimacy in the blockchain ecosystem.
